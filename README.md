# üåç Planet Component

This is a **3D Planet Component** created using React Three Fiber and Drei, with a GLTF model designed on Sketchfab.  
The planet rotates with lighting and shadows ‚Äî perfect for creating an aesthetic hero section or 3D interactive background !

## About the Model

- The 3D model is sourced from [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/).
- The model format used is `.gltf` ‚Äî an efficient format for transmitting 3D scenes and models.
- Associated `.bin` file contains mesh data like geometry , normals , animations etc.

### What is `.gltf` ?

- **GL Transmission Format (GLTF)** is an open-standard 3D file format.
- It contains **scene structure, materials, textures** , animations , and more.
- It is lightweight and optimized for runtime transmission.

### What is `.bin` ?

- The `.bin` file stores **binary mesh data** (vertex positions, normals, tangents, skinning weights).
- It is referenced inside the `.gltf` file to provide geometry details.
